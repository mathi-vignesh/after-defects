# AE Downgrader

A web tool to downgrade After Effects project files (`.aep`) and effect presets (`.ffx`) from newer versions to older ones.

## How it works

After Effects files use the **RIFX binary format**. The version of AE that created the file is stored as a 16-bit integer inside a `tdsn` chunk. This tool:

1. Parses the RIFX structure to find and read that version integer
2. Maps it to an AE release name (e.g. `3520` → *After Effects 2024*)
3. Lets you pick a lower target version
4. Patches the version bytes in place and returns the modified file

> ⚠️ **Limitation**: This is a version-byte patch, not a full re-encode. Projects that use effects, expressions, or features not available in the target version will still fail to open. Always test the downgraded file before using it in production.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd ae-downgrader
docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## Development (without Docker)

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8000`, so both servers work together out of the box.
